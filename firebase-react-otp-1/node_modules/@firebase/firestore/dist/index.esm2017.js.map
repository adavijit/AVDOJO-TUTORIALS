Specifically the server splits paths into segments first and then\n * sorts, putting end-of-segment before any character. In a UTF-8 string\n * encoding the slash ('/') that denotes the end-of-segment naturally comes\n * after other characters so the intent here is to encode the path delimiters in\n * such a way that the resulting strings sort naturally.\n *\n * Resource paths are also used for prefix scans so it's important to\n * distinguish whole segments from any longer segments of which they might be a\n * prefix. For example, it's important to make it possible to scan documents in\n * a collection \"foo\" without encountering documents in a collection \"foobar\".\n *\n * Separate from the concerns about resource path ordering and separation,\n * On Android, SQLite imposes additional restrictions since it does not handle\n * keys with embedded NUL bytes particularly well. Rather than change the\n * implementation we keep the encoding identical to keep the ports similar.\n *\n * Taken together this means resource paths when encoded for storage in\n * IndexedDB have the following characteristics:\n *\n *   * Segment separators (\"/\") sort before everything else.\n *   * All paths have a trailing separator.\n *   * NUL bytes do not exist in the output, since IndexedDB doesn't treat them\n * well.\n *\n * Therefore resource paths are encoded into string form using the following\n * rules:\n *\n *   * '\\x01' is used as an escape character.\n *   * Path separators are encoded as \"\\x01\\x01\"\n *   * NUL bytes are encoded as \"\\x01\\x10\"\n *   * '\\x01' is encoded as \"\\x01\\x11\"\n *\n * This encoding leaves some room between path separators and the NUL byte\n * just in case we decide to support integer document ids after all.\n *\n * Note that characters treated specially by the backend ('.', '/', and '~')\n * are not treated specially here.

All read / write operations must be wrapped in a\n * transaction. Implementations of PersistenceTransaction / Persistence only\n * need to guarantee that writes made against the transaction are not made to\n * durable storage until the transaction resolves its PersistencePromise.\n * Since memory-only storage components do not alter durable storage, they are\n * free to ignore the transaction.\n *\n * This contract is enough to allow the LocalStore be be written\n * independently of whether or not the stored state actually is durably\n * persisted. If persistent storage is enabled, writes are grouped together to\n * avoid inconsistent state that could cause crashes.\n *\n * Concretely, when persistent storage is enabled, the persistent versions of\n * MutationQueue, RemoteDocumentCache, and others (the mutators) will\n * defer their writes into a transaction. Once the local store has completed\n * one logical operation, it commits the transaction.\n *\n * When persistent storage is disabled, the non-persistent versions of the\n * mutators ignore the transaction. This short-cut is allowed because\n * memory-only storage leaves no state so it cannot be inconsistent.\n *\n * This simplifies the implementations of the mutators and allows memory-only\n * implementations to supplement the persistent ones without requiring any\n * special dual-store implementation of Persistence. The cost is that the\n * LocalStore needs to be slightly careful about the order of its reads and\n * writes in order to avoid relying on being able to read back uncommitted\n * writes.\n */\nexport interface Persistence {\n  /**\n   * Whether or not this persistence instance has been started.\n   */\n  readonly started: boolean;\n\n  readonly referenceDelegate: ReferenceDelegate;\n\n  /**\n   * Releases any resources held during eager shutdown.\n   */\n  shutdown(): Promise<void>;\n\n  /**\n   * Registers a listener that gets called when the primary state of the\n   * instance changes.

Data is stored persistently\n * across sessions.\n *\n * On Web only, the Firestore SDKs support shared access to its persistence\n * layer. This allows multiple browser tabs to read and write to IndexedDb and\n * to synchronize state even without network connectivity. Shared access is\n * currently optional and not enabled unless all clients invoke\n * `enablePersistence()` with `{synchronizeTabs:true}`.\n *\n * In multi-tab mode, if multiple clients are active at the same time, the SDK\n * will designate one client as the “primary client”. An effort is made to pick\n * a visible, network-connected and active client, and this client is\n * responsible for letting other clients know about its presence. The primary\n * client writes a unique client-generated identifier (the client ID) to\n * IndexedDb’s “owner” store every 4 seconds. If the primary client fails to\n * update this entry, another client can acquire the lease and take over as\n * primary.\n *\n * Some persistence operations in the SDK are designated as primary-client only\n * operations. This includes the acknowledgment of mutations and all updates of\n * remote documents. The effects of these operations are written to persistence\n * and then broadcast to other tabs via LocalStorage (see\n * `WebStorageSharedClientState`), which then refresh their state from\n * persistence.\n *\n * Similarly, the primary client listens to notifications sent by secondary\n * clients to discover persistence changes written by secondary clients, such as\n * the addition of new mutations and query targets.\n *\n * If multi-tab is not enabled and another tab already obtained the primary\n * lease, IndexedDbPersistence enters a failed state and all subsequent\n * operations will automatically fail.\n *\n * Additionally, there is an optimization so that when a tab is closed, the\n * primary lease is released immediately (this is especially important to make\n * sure that a refreshed tab is able to immediately re-acquire the primary\n * lease). Unfortunately, IndexedDB cannot be reliably used in window.unload\n * since it is an asynchronous API. So in addition to attempting to give up the\n * lease, the leaseholder writes its client ID to a \"zombiedClient\" entry in\n * LocalStorage which acts as an indicator that another tab should go ahead and\n * take the primary lease immediately regardless of the current lease timestamp.\n *\n * TODO(b/114226234): Remove `synchronizeTabs` section when multi-tab is no\n * longer optional.\n */\nexport
